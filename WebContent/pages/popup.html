           <b>1. Privacy & Security </b> <br>
     <p> Harrier reserves the right to modify its privacy and security policies in its reasonable discretion from time to time.  Individual Users when they initially log in will be asked whether they wish to receive marketing and other non-critical Service-related communications from Harrier from time to time.  They may opt out of receiving such communications at that time or at any subsequent time.  Note that because the Service is a hosted, online application, Harrier occasionally may need to notify all Service Users (whether or not they have opted out as described above) of important announcements regarding the operation of the Service.</p> <br>     
            <b>2. License Grant & Restrictions </b> <br>

       <p>You may not access the Service if you are a direct competitor of Harrier, except with Harrier's prior written consent. In addition, you may not access the Service for purposes of monitoring its availability, performance or functionality, or for any other benchmarking or competitive purposes.</p>
